dpd-s3
=================

Deployd module for a resource to GET/POST to and from an AWS s3 bucket

This is based on Ritchie Martori's origin version ( https://github.com/deployd/dpd-s3 ) which was un-published from npm as it didn't work.  Ritchie accepted the pull request with my changes to make it work again, but hasn't ever re-published it.  So I am publishing it as I frequently use it.
